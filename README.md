Agents of P.R.I.S.M
==================

This is our **award winning** entry at the **London GameCraft 2013**.

The game is written in **Dart** using the **StageXL** framework, and developed from scratch by one person in less than 11 hours, it's also the first time I have used **Dart** in ernest.

# Game Idea

The theme given to us was 'Impact of P.R.I.S.M'.

To answer the question directly, it's the creation of a surveillance capability that whilst can serve to help prevent crime and terrorist attacks, is also subject to misuse and abuse.

If underused and unable to stop the sort of disaster it is intended to prevent, it’ll no doubt come under much public criticism. On the other hand, if it’s misused or overused and cause too much intrusion to everyday lives of innocent people then it’ll also cause public unrest. It is therefore a fine balance between not doing enough and doing too much, and it is this need for balance that we wanted to focus on with Agents of P.R.I.S.M.

# Mission Brief

As an agent with access to P.R.I.S.M, your task is to identify a criminal out of a set of potential targets, and you have a set of surveillance options that can be used against each of these targets, in the order of each option’s cost and level of effectiveness and intrusiveness:

1. **CCTV surveillance**

Least expensive, effective and intrusive

2. **Credit card surveillance**

3. **Email surveillance**

4. **Phone surveillance**

5. Send agents on the field to conduct **in-person surveillance**

Most expensive, effective and intrusive, this is truly a high risk, high reward approach.


As the agent in charge, you need to balance against:

**Time**

If you don’t identify the criminal before time runs out then he gets away and you failed your task, so move fast! 

**Intrusion level**

If you’re too aggressive with your use of surveillance options then it’ll make the citizens unhappy, when they become angry with how much you’re intruding on their lives it leads to civil unrest and you lose.

**Budget**

Government agencies have to operate within its budget, so do you, spend carelessly on expensive surveillance options will drain your budget and when you run out of budget you can no longer catch the criminal and you lose. 

As you progress through the levels, the amount of budget and time you have and number of potential suspects will change and make the game more and more challenging.
